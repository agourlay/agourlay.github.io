Hi, I am Arnaud Gourlay.

On this blog I mostly write about Rust and performance related things.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/agourlay) where I share and maintain various tools, sometimes on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@agourlay) or you could contact me via [email](mailto:arnaud.gourlay@gmail.com).

I currently work on an open source distributed vector database at [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/).

Here is my [resume](/about/agourlay-cv.pdf).
