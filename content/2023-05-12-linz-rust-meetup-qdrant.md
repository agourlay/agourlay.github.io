I had the privilege and pleasure to give a talk at the [Rust Meetup Linz](https://rust-linz.at/) about my work as a full time contributor on the [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) vector search engine.

I wanted the talk to be rather accessible given that vector search engines have recently been gaining popularity.

The presentation is structured roughly in two parts:

First the focus is on the use cases for the technology to really understand where it shines.

The second part is about peeking under the hood to take a closer look at the internals, and to see why Rust is such a good fit for the job.

The slides are available [here](/2023-05-12/rust-linz-meetup-qdrant.pdf) and the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cGM1fEbWJQ).
